## An Image Control and PictureBox Replacement With Zoom In/Out


</div>

### Description

An Image Control as well as Picture Box Replacement. it contains a lot of funcionality but as it uses pure Win32 APIs it is very hard to document this fucntionality.

You can open and Image and use the key combination:

Ctrl+NumPad '+' to Zoom In and

Ctrl+NumPad '-' to Zoom Out

There are many other hidden functions like Set Brightness, Create Scan Line Effects, etc. but will document them later on.

Cheers
